⚡ SuperPage

The decentralized tipping protocol for the modern creator economy — powered by Web3.


🔥 What is SuperPage?
SuperPage is a Web3-based social tipping platform that empowers creators to receive crypto tips directly on their GitHub, YouTube, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, and other pages — without gatekeepers, ads, or high platform fees.
Fans can tip creators instantly using a browser extension that injects a sleek "Tip" button right into social platforms, backed by smart contracts and multi-chain wallets.
🌍 Why SuperPage?
Creators today face:

🚫 Platform fees (YouTube 45%, Twitch 30%, Patreon 12%)
🎯 Hard eligibility criteria
💸 No Web3-native tipping solution across platforms
🧑‍💻 No reward model for open-source developers
SuperPage solves this with:
✅ Cross-platform tipping via Chrome Extension
✅ Direct wallet payments with no middlemen
✅ Creator dashboard to manage tips, analytics, and social links
✅ NFT "Supporter Moments" and Creator Tokens (coming soon)
