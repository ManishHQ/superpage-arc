# ⚡ D-Page

> The decentralized tipping protocol for the modern creator economy — powered by Web3.

## 🔥 What is D-Page?

D-Page is a **Web3-based social tipping platform** that empowers creators to receive crypto tips directly on their **GitHub, YouTube, X (Twitter), LinkedIn**, and other pages — without gatekeepers, ads, or high platform fees.

Fans can tip creators instantly using a browser extension that injects a sleek **"Tip" button** right into social platforms, backed by **smart contracts** and **multi-chain wallets**.

## 🌍 Why D-Page?

Creators today face:

- 🚫 Platform fees (YouTube 45%, Twitch 30%, Patreon 12%)
- 🎯 Hard eligibility criteria
- 💸 No Web3-native tipping solution across platforms
- 🧑‍💻 No reward model for open-source developers

**D-Page** solves this with:

- ✅ Cross-platform tipping via Chrome Extension
- ✅ Direct wallet payments with no middlemen
- ✅ Creator dashboard to manage tips, analytics, and social links
- ✅ NFT “Supporter Moments” and Creator Tokens (coming soon)
